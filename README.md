# arkham-versus-draft
A tool to run competitive and team-vs-team drafts for Arkham Horror: The Card Game. It's very similar to Magic: The Gathering's "team draft" variant of booster drafting. Meant for two or more teams of investigators to draft decks and then complete scenarios or campaigns independently for points.

## Startup

To run the app

```
python3 app.py

## Disclaimer
This was simply a thing I wanted to exist as a player, not a project I am exercising my personal chops on, and as such I do not vouch for the quality of any of the code here, which was 100% generated by copilot.
